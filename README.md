#HTML5-Toolset
###Mark Addinall 2005-2015

UPDATE.  Halting work on this as it has served for a good decade
being a PHP 4/5 front end and back end for many web apps.

Circa mid-2015 there are now better ways of achieving elegant applications.
I am now going to concentrate on HTML5/CSS3-Sass/AngularJS and still a little PHP5 at the VERY back end feeding JSON data to the application.  For this I will pinch my own database and config objects, and I think the rest is pretty
much finished.

This is unfinished work in progress of my long suffering toolset. I decided that I had no RESPONSIVE CSS in my armory, so I wanted to implement that. I have also been playing with HTML5 and CSS3 so I wanted to incorporate that into my new applications. So I decided to re-write all of my toolset up to v4.0.

When finished (soon I hope) it will provide a Framework for RAD and AGILE Web development, and provide a Content Management system in the guise of Chameleon 4.0 as part of the suite.

I don't need collaborators, not until I say "There, those are done for this version" at least!

This code is published under a BSD licence, but I would ask that you not copy it until I say it has passed my tests for completion. It is a work in progress, so it is not viable for use just yet. When it is finished, go for it.

Thank you.
