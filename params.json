{"name":"Html5-toolset","tagline":"New HTML5 and CSS3 Toolset and RESPONSIVE Framework","body":"This is unfinished work in progress of my long suffering toolset. I decided that I had no RESPONSIVE CSS in my armory, so I wanted to implement that. I have also been playing with HTML5 and CSS3 so I wanted to incorporate that into my new applications. So I decided to re-write all of my toolset up to v4.0.\r\n\r\nWhen finished (soon I hope) it will provide a Framework for RAD and AGILE Web development, and provide a Content Management system in the guise of Chameleon 4.0 as part of the suite.\r\n\r\nI don't need collaborators, not until I say \"There, those are done for this version\" at least!\r\n\r\nThis code is published under a BSD licence, but I would ask that you not copy it until I say it has passed my tests for completion. It is a work in progress, so it is not viable for use just yet. When it is finished, go for it.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nMark Addinall\r\naddinall@addinall.net\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
